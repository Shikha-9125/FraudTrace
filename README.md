<pre> # 🧠 Fraud Detection System – AI Powered 🔍 A machine learning-based web application to detect potential fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. The system combines a **Flask backend** and a **React frontend**, providing an intuitive UI for file uploads, fraud analysis, visual metrics, and PDF report downloads. 🎥 **[Project Demo (Video)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d8dgesjiLbdEAr99mHwAw9AOIRSyV-eS/view?usp=sharing)** --- ## 🚀 Features - 📤 CSV File Upload with drag & drop support - 🔎 Fraud Detection using a Random Forest model - 📊 Real-time Visual Metrics: - Fraud Distribution (Pie Chart) - Confusion Matrix (Bar Chart) - Accuracy and F1 Score - 📥 Downloadable PDF Report - 🌘 Light/Dark Mode Toggle - 📈 Upload Progress Bar & File Preview --- ## 🛠 Tech Stack **Frontend:** - React.js - Tailwind CSS - Axios - React Router - Recharts (for data visualization) - React Dropzone **Backend:** - Flask - Pandas, NumPy - Scikit-learn, SMOTE - Flask-CORS - ReportLab (PDF generation) --- ## 📁 Project Structure <code> backend/ ├── app.py # Flask API for upload, processing, and report generation ├── uploads/ # Stores uploaded CSV files frontend/ ├── src/ │ ├── App.jsx # Routing logic │ ├── pages/ # Upload & Results pages │ ├── components/ # Charts, Dropzone, SummaryCard │ ├── index.css # Tailwind styles ├── package.json # React project config </code> --- ## 📈 How It Works 1. User uploads a CSV file (must contain `isFraud` column). 2. Frontend sends the file to the backend via `POST /upload`. 3. Backend: - Reads and preprocesses the file - Applies SMOTE for class balancing - Trains a Random Forest model - Calculates Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix 4. Frontend: - Displays results via graphs and summary card - Allows user to download a detailed report via `GET /download-report` --- ## 🧪 Run the App Locally ### 🔧 Backend ```bash cd backend pip install -r requirements.txt python app.py ``` ### 💻 Frontend ```bash cd frontend npm install npm run dev ``` --- ## 📎 Sample CSV Format Make sure your CSV includes at least the `isFraud` column: ```csv step,amount,type,isFraud 1,100.00,CASH,0 2,2500.00,TRANSFER,1 ``` --- ✅ Built with ❤️ for smarter financial security! </pre>
